    <h1 class="heading">About Us</h1>
    <p class="bas">
      Welcome to <i><b> VISHAL</b></i
      >, your number one source for all things. We're dedicated to giving you
      the very best of products, with a focus on three characteristics, ie:
      dependability, customer service and uniqueness. Founded in 2009 by Mr.
      <b><i>BADRI VISHAL SINGHAL</i></b
      >, Vishal has come a long way from its beginnings in a home office. When
      Badri sir first started out, his passion for creating a startup drove him
      to do intense research, quit his day job, and gave him the impetus to turn
      hard work and inspiration into to a booming online store. We now serve
      customers all over India, and are thrilled to be a part of the quirky,
      eco-friendly and fair trade wing of the industry. We hope you enjoy our
      products as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any
      questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us. <br /><br />
      Sincerely,
      <br />
      Badri Vishal Singhal
      <br />CEO, Founder
    </p>
